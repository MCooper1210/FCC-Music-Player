## Description
This project is one of the beginner JavaScript challenges from freeCodeCamp. In this Music Player users can play, pause, and skip songs from a playlist. Users can also delete songs, shuffle the playlist, and see the currently playing song's details. The interface updates dynamically to reflect the current song, providing an interactive audio experience.
